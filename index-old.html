            <p>
              In many ways, the Tibetan community has been under constant attack ever since coming into exile in 1959. This report seeks to examine the ways in which attacks and threats have evolved in today’s digital age starting from approximately 2002 and spanning roughly twenty years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since Tibet’s illegal occupation by China from the early 1950s onwards, Tibetans inside Tibet have resisted and this resistance continues today. Since His Holiness the Dalai Lama was forced to flee from Lhasa in March 1959 and live in exile in India, the Tibetan exile community that has grown into hundreds of thousands of people have been continuing resistance and vocally opposing China’s rule at the grassroots and advocacy level. The global recognition for the Dalai Lama, the resistance activities led by Tibetans both inside and outside Tibet, the activities of the Tibetan Government in Exile (Central Tibetan Administration) as well as a worldwide Tibet network of Tibet Support Groups are a constant obstruction to the Chinese government’s efforts for full control over Tibet and a threat to China’s reputation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This report provides a first of its kind comprehensive overview on the evolution of digital threats to Tibetans in exile and also an account of the resolve to counter these threats and overcome them. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-3 title" id="tech">II. Technology and the Tibet Movement</h2>
            <p>
              The internet first came to the Tibetan exile capital of Dharamsala in northern India in the mid 1990s. At that time, non-Tibetans, together with the Tibetan Computer Resource Centre, helped the exile government to set up an Internet-connected Local Area Network between all 7 ministries, the Kashag, Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, and several other offices with dialup connectivity to the Private Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the Norbulingka Institute and other important locations<b class="footnote">&sup1<span>Dan Haig - How the internet came to Dharamsala</span></b>. In 2000, the exile government’s web presence (on Tibet [.] Net) was being established and the network consisted of over 120 computers.

            <p>
              A digital system and web presence for His Holiness the Dalai Lama started to be established also at around this time. The website DalaiLama.com is recorded as having been registered on December 18, 1996<b class="footnote">&sup3<span>Source: <a href="https://who.is/whois/dalailama.com">https://who.is/whois/dalailama.com</a> (accessed December 8, 2022)</span></b>. At that time, monks from the Private Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama were managing the Office’s email, maintaining databases, hosting the website and managing the content. The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama would schedule His Holiness’ meetings with international diplomats and religious leaders around the globe primarily through email.

            </p>
            <p>
              Outside the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan exile government, like everyone else around the globe, civil society and the worldwide Tibet movement was also going through the experiences brought by the ever changing world of technology. Previously highly regionalized, the Tibet movement started evolving into a globally coordinated one.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the earliest documented targeted attacks on the Tibetan community in exile took place in 2002. The Tibetan Computer Resource Centre in Dharamsala which administers the computer system of the Tibetan Government in Exile, through their spokesperson Jigme Tsering revealed in an interview to a UK online news site in September 2002 that there had been repeated attempts to infect the exile government’s computers with malware in order to obtain information. 
            </p>

            </video>
            <p>
              On September 27, 2002, Tsering issued a statement detailing Chinese attempts to infiltrate the computers of TGIE saying, “A number of targeted computer viruses circulating via email throughout the Tibetan Government-in-exile and Tibetan support groups and related NGOs have been discovered or brought to our attention. These viruses have appeared in a number of variants, indicating a progressive and sustained development process. <br>For example, some were taking advantage of known security loopholes in Microsoft software in order to automatically run and are always personalized to impersonate departmental emails following previous attempts to collect email address lists. One variant analyzed was found to have been sourced from the Yunnan Province in China,br and was designed to collect information of an infected computer and send it via email to an address in Beijing <b class="footnote"><sup>4</sup><span>Chinese Internet group found spying on Tibetan government computers”, <a href="https://savetibet.org/chinese-internet-group-found-spying-on-tibetan-government-computers/">International Campaign for Tibet, October 28, 2003</a> </span></b>.” 
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-3 title" id="digital-threat">III. Digital Threats and Their Origins</h2>
            <p>
              The emergence and proliferation of information technology in the Tibetan community in exile has been integral for strengthening the Tibetan movement, expanding communication opportunities, and providing information on Tibetan culture. However, as infrastructure, tools, and knowledge spread through the community, so do online threats perpetrated by groups tied to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). These groups take advantage of relatively low levels of information security capacity in the Tibetan community to infiltrate the communications ecosystem and monitor groups and individuals. Based on our analysis of public research reports on information security threats observed in the Tibetan diaspora and from testimonies received from targeted organizations and individuals, we were able to uncover the technical and social engineering strategies involved behind the past 20 years of information security threats targeting the Tibetan community. Our understanding of these targeted attacks is also an outcome of our direct experiences and lessons learned through TibCERT's initiatives over the years in supporting numerous Tibetan organizations and individuals regarding the prevention and mitigation of these cyber security threats in the diaspora community. 
            </p>
           <p>
           <p>
             Ever Since the earliest days of cyber attacks against the Tibetan community were observed over two decades before, the targeted threat landscape has tremendously evolved over the same period. Much of the cyber attacks throughout the years consists of deploying malwares which were carefully crafted with moderate technical sophistication yet consisting of high social engineering tactics mostly used in the form of targeted emails. The majority of the targeted victims of these cyber attacks were Tibetan Non-Governmental Offices (NGOs), The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), Tibetan Activists and Journalists. The prevalent medium/vector of these attacks were in the form of targeted emails consisting of malicious attachments and links, compromising websites through watering hole attacks as well as through 1-Click Mobile Exploits sent via mobile text messages. These attacks were designed to infect all types of prominent OS platforms namely Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. One interesting observation in our analysis uncovers the fact that the threat actors were successful in infecting systems repeatedly in their malware campaigns from 2013-2016 by exploiting the same security vulnerabilities of a victim’s system(s) with outdated malwares. The older vulnerabilities exploited by those outdated malwares were already patched by microsoft through their regular security updates. The persistent use of this known and patched exploit indicates that the attackers were still finding success with it in operations against the community, likely due to targets using unpatched systems and possibly unauthentic versions of Windows. 
           </p>
           <p>
             Following through the early days of internet infrastructure development period in the Tibetan diaspora community to the relentless cyber attacks observed ever since, TibCERT has also provided recommendations in strengthening the overall defense and resilience of our community in these regards. It is of grave concern that with the growing awareness of cyber security threats and constantly evolving digital infrastructures within the Tibetan community in diaspora, the threat actors are also raising their efforts and sophistication in unleashing cyber attacks to infiltrate our movement in exile. It is our collective belief that coalition and collaborative efforts in the field of technology and digital security in our community is very essential to keep our Tibet movement one step ahead in the era of digital revolution.
           </p>

           <p>
             Since the <a href="https://savetibet.org/chinese-internet-group-found-spying-on-tibetan-government-computers/">earliest recorded cyber attacks in 2002</a>, Tibetans and Tibet supporters have been under constant attack. These cyber-attacks on multiple fronts aim to target not just individuals in the Tibet movement’s leadership but also the general public and the reasons for them can be to disrupt the movement and its credibility, steal movement-related information and to infiltrate the movement network.
           </p>
           <p>
             For years, although Tibetans had no doubts that the cyber attacks were coming from China, there was a lack of capacity to carry out extensive research on them and uncover evidence. Therefore it was a challenge to bring global attention to the new front of China’s cyber assault on the Tibet movement. One of the first research reports to expose the inner workings of malware-based cyber espionage with an explicit focus on Tibetans in exile was “Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network”, published in 2009 by Citizen Lab based at the University of Toronto and The SecDev Group, based in Ottawa, Canada <b class="footnote"><sup>5</sup>
              <span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ghostnet.pdf">“Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network" (accessed December 8, 2022)</a></span></b>. The study revealed the existence and operational reach of a cyber espionage network named “GhostNet”. The investigations began with Tibetan computer systems and ultimately uncovered a network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries. The targeted malware was sent to Tibetan institutions such as the Offices of Tibet, the Tibetan Government-in-Exile and even to the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. In addition, the investigation looked at a Tibetan NGO called Drewla (sic). The Drelwa Initiative Project based in Dharamsala sought new ways to communicate directly with citizens of the People’s Republic of China online. While the report presented in-depth research of the attacks, it stopped short of naming China as the culprit, the report stated “attributing all Chinese malware to deliberate or targeted intelligence gathering operations by the Chinese state is wrong and misleading.”
           </p>

           <p>
             In April 2010, a follow up report was published titled “Shadows In the Cloud” which monitored a spy operation called the Shadow Network and demonstrated how it systematically hacked into personal computers in government offices on several continents. The investigation recovered a large quantity of stolen documents, including from agencies of the Indian national security establishment and the Offices of the Dalai Lama <b class="footnote"><sup>6</sup><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/science/06cyber.html">New York Times, Researchers Trace Data Theft to Intruders in China,[accessed December 16, 2022]</a></span></b>. The report analyzed the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers and traced the core servers to being located in China, the attackers staging their operations from Chengdu, Sichuan province. 
           </p>
           <p>
             A subsequent report that firmly traced cyber espionage back to China was by the civil society research group Mandiant (now owned by Google). Their 2013 report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units <b class="footnote"><sup>7</sup><span><a href="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf">Mandiant, APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units</a>[accessed December 16, 2022]</span></b>” focused on China’s cyber espionage with targets in the US, Canada, and UK that included governments, international cooperation and development agencies, and multinational corporations. Their investigations tracked this activity back to APT1 or Unit 61398, a bureau under the People's Liberation Army. Mandiant’s findings were also reinforced by Citizen Lab <b class="footnote"><sup>8</sup><span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2013/02/apt1s-glasses-watching-a-human-rights-organization/"> Citizen Lab, APT1’s GLASSES – Watching a Human Rights Organization</a>[accessed December 16, 2022]
</span></b>.
           </p>
           <p>
             Their report APT1: <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf">Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units</a> released on February 19, 2013, on page 5 clearly stated ‘The nature of “Unit 61398’s” work is considered by China to be a state secret; however, we believe it engages in harmful “Computer Network Operations.”’
           </p>
           <p>
             Mandiant’s findings were reinforced by Citizen Lab. In their post <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2013/02/apt1s-glasses-watching-a-human-rights-organization/">APT1’s GLASSES – Watching a Human Rights Organization</a> published on February 25, 2013 Citizen Lab stated: “The malicious program analyzed at Citizen Lab shares both a large percentage of code and the same command and control (C2) infrastructure as the program described in the APT1 report. We are calling this program GLASSES because it is related to GOGGLES and uses a compromised eyeglasses storefront website as its C2 server.”

           <h2 class="mb-3 title" id="frontliners">IV. On the Frontlines</h2>

           <p>
             In part IV we highlight individuals and organizations who have come under varying forms of digital attack. While some attacks target a person, other types of attacks hack websites or send malware embedded in mobile apps.

              <p><i>It was unnerving to have people on my Skype who knew our code names and who seemed determined to seek out our location. It was the kind of thing that really got into my head because it was intimidating and made me question my safety. In many ways I think that the psychological effects of this kind of incident is underestimated or not taken into consideration. There was a thuggishness to the tone of the messages that made me feel uncomfortable. - Kate Woznow, December 2022</i></p>
          </div>
        <p>
         Kate Woznow was using Skype to coordinate high-profile Tibet protests and to communicate with activists in London, Beijing, Seoul, San Francisco and New York. Skype was also being used widely to speak to the media. As the Olympic Games were just getting underway (but before any Tibet protests had taken place by activists) in late July/early August 2008, Kate started to receive Skype messages from someone who addressed her by her code name and they also knew the code name of her colleague Students for a Free Tibet’s Executive Director Lhadon Tethong. The messages were written in a tone to suggest that the persona and Kate already knew each other. They were asking if she was in Hong Kong and wanted to do import and export business. The persona seemed to be trying to seek out her location and asking about Hong Kong was noteworthy as she had been based there while involved in a 2006 action coordinating a Beijing protest of the railway to Tibet.
       </p>
       <p>
         Later on during the Olympic Games and with the activist protests taking place frequently, another similar incident occurred and the people behind the messages were able to directly message Kate and Lhadon on their Skype code names trying to get in touch with them, indicating that they knew that they were leading the Olympics campaign together.
       </p>
       <p>
         This type of attack is known as a “social engineering” attack. Social engineering has been a method used to try to extract information from Tibet and Tibetan activists. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, social engineering is defined as “attempts to trick people into giving secret or personal information, especially on the internet, and using it for harmful purposes”<b class="footnote"><sup>9</sup><span><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/social-engineering">https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/social-engineering</a></span></b>.

              At first I was quite amused that Chengl Li, who is an influential person is actually thinking about Tibet, and is looking out for self-immolations which is a painful, awful issue for all the Tibetans and he is genuinely wanting to help and looking to me for help. My initial feeling that I had was very positive and that was based on the person that was supposedly sending me this email, their profile and their relevance to  our work, the importance in the field of at least China kind of analysts, thinkers, experts and also there was some very quick reaction I had that felt glad, positive that such a person would reach out to us and to me at that time. Once I realized pretty quickly that it was suspicious, I thought it was the “happy Tib Losar!” that struck me  as not the language that someone like this person was supposedly would use. So very quickly i was suspicious and  then also I remembered thinking that this was good, that was well crafted, researched, targeted attack  and i wouldn't say I was impressed but maybe my blood ran a little cold recognizing how sophisticated  this kind of social engineering to me from what to me there was no question it must be a Chinese government backed attack.

              Lhadon Tethong was herself the target of a social engineering attack in 2012, this time carried out over email. By 2012, Lhadon Tethong was the Director of Tibet Action Institute that had been founded in 2009 and the social engineering attack occurred on her Tibet Action Institute official work email. She found herself corresponding with someone claiming to be Cheng Li, a real person at  prestigious Washington DC think tank The Brookings Institution, Director of the John L. Thornton China Center and a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy program

              She was at first pleasantly surprised to receive an email from such a prominent person and as it was the period of news of many self-immolations taking place in Tibet, the premise seemed plausible. Since the self-immolation protests started in Tibet, Lhadon Tethong had been the point of contact for the media and working to make the self-immolation protests in Tibet known to the outside world, particularly at this time in 2012 when self-immolations were at their height. As Tibet Action Institute was specializing in digital security, Lhadon was aware of being a target for attacks so she forwarded the email to The Citizen Lab. When studying the attachment, it was found that the malware contained a Windows based malware. Realizing that hackers were trying to compromise her computer but in order to investigate the depth of the hacker's resources,  Lhadon Tethong replied to the email saying that she was having trouble opening the attachment on her Mac computer.

              Within 12 days of the first email, on March 6, 2012, she received a reply from the attacker. This time the attacker sent a link that was a refurbished malware for Mac. If she had clicked on the link, the malware would have used the system’s vulnerability to compromise her Mac.

            This case shows how a member of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile (TPiE) was a prime target of attackers. The tactics of attackers have also changed and evolved as the malware becomes more sophisticated, specifically designed to infect Android phones, the most used mobile operating system in the Tibetan Community. 
          </p>
          <p>
            TPiE, officially the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration, is the unicameral and highest legislative organ of CTA. It is one of the three pillars of Tibetan democratic governance - the Judiciary, Legislature, and the Kashag (Executive). The parliament sessions are held twice a year with an interval of six months, one in March and one in September. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In this instance, a Tibetan Parliamentarian’s email was imitated and used to send a spoofed email to a prominent Tibetan advocate based in the USA. The Parliamentarian may have been targeted for being a member of the monastic community, involved in activism and also as someone who was born and grew up in Tibet.

            The spoofed email sent on January 16, 2013, contained an attachment of two APK files, one for KakaoTalk, a South Korean mobile messaging app for Android and one for TuneIn, an app through which Tibetans can listen to Tibetan language radio stations such as Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Citizen Lab found that the APKs of KakaoTalk and Tunein attached to the email were both altered versions and contained malware if installed. The malicious TuneIn Radio APK added permissions that would allow attackers “to collect the user’s contacts, SMS message history and cellular network location <b class="footnote"><sup>10</sup><span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2013/04/permission-to-spy-an-analysis-of-android-malware-targeting-tibetans/">Permission to Spy: An Analysis of Android Malware Targeting Tibetans” By Seth Hardy, Byron Sonne, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Jakub Dalek, Ron Deibert, and Adam Senft, April 18, 2013</a>(accessed March 24, 2023)</span></b>.”

            The timing of this email was also interesting as KakaoTalk had just been recommended to the MP by Tibet Action Institute’s Lobsang Gyatso Sither then the Digital Security Programs Director due to security concerns about WeChat having been raised. The spoofed email was an exact copy of the original email, the content was the same and the only thing in the email that had been altered was the KakaoTalk and Tunein APK files to contain malware. One other difference was that the sender was not the original Parliamentarian sender (the sender was now uygur52[@]gmx.com) and the recipient was another Tibetan prominent figure.

            Upon analysis, Citizen Lab found that the rigged version of KakaoTalk and Tunein used illegitimate certificates that would have prevented it from getting into the Google Play market for Android apps, and required the user to agree to a longer list of permissions <b class="footnote"><sup>11</sup><span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2013/04/permission-to-spy-an-analysis-of-android-malware-targeting-tibetans/">https://citizenlab.ca/2013/04/permission-to-spy-an-analysis-of-android-malware-targeting-tibetans/</a></span></b>.

            The Kakao sample was the second instance of targeted Android malware to appear in just two weeks. In late March, Kaspersky detected another rigged app APK related to a conference of peoples oppressed by China that had been similarly designed to steal contacts, messages and location data.

            An evolution of social engineering attacks has been malware delivered on smartphone devices via WhatsApp. Tibetan institutions and individuals have seen their iOS and Android devices targeted by hacks delivered in WhatsApp messages. With a single click of the link within the WhatsApp chat text, their device would have a permanent tracker installed on it, in some cases, stolen credentials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among those targeted by attackers between November 2018 and May 2019 were the offices of the Dalai Lama, the Central Tibetan Administration, Parliamentarians and Tibetan human rights groups. A total of 17 intrusion attempts were made over this period. It is still unclear how the hackers got hold of the targeted individuals, organizations details or contact numbers but the numbers may have been scraped from various websites or social media accounts. All the infection attempts <b class="footnote"><sup>12</sup><span> <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/09/poison-carp-tibetan-groups-targeted-with-1-click-mobile-exploits">Missing Link:Tibetan Groups Targeted with 1-Click Mobile Exploits” By Bill Marczak, Adam Hulcoop, Etienne Maynier, Bahr Abdul Razzak, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, John Scott-Railton, and Ron Deibert,  September 24, 2019</a>(accessed March 24, 2023)
        </span></b> were made with careful social engineering tactics where the attacker managed to get the Whatsapp contact number of its targets and seem to have a preconceived notion of who the targeted individual was, in terms of their role and reputation in the Tibetan community in exile.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the victims of the 1-Click WhatsApp attack was Lhagyari Namgyal Dolkar. Dharamsala based Lhagyari Namgyal Dolkar is a long time member of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile and headed the prominent non-governmental organization, Gu-Chu-Sum at that time, that advocates for former Tibetan political prisoners for many years. Prior to that she was active with the Tibetan Women's Association so is a well known member of civil society as well as hailing from a prominent Tibetan family.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the night of November 12, 2018, she received a message in WhatsApp from someone claiming to be the head of Amnesty International by the name “Jason Wu” about a self-immolation protest that had allegedly taken place in Tibet. She was then the President of Gu-Chu-Sum and often received messages from media groups about self-immolation cases that were happening inside Tibet. At first she thought this message was legitimate, afterwards, Namgyal Dolmar felt that there was something suspicious about “Jason Wu” especially because he kept pushing her to click on the link. Instead of clicking on the link, Namgyal Dolkar forwarded the link to TibCERT who, together with Citizen lab, deemed the link as the first series of one-click mobile exploits used against Tibetans.

         <p>
           Later it was found that the link led to code designed to exploit mobile web browser vulnerabilities to install spyware on iOS and Android devices, and in some cases to OAuth phishing pages.
         </p>
         <p>
          Anyone who was running an up-to-date Android or iOS at the time should’ve been protected from infection. For those who hadn’t updated and were successfully hacked, their WhatsApp and Facebook messages, location, contacts, call and text histories, and emails could have been sent back to the hackers.

             “Considering the work we do, which directly revolves around exposing China for its various forms of human rights abuses in Tibet, and also because similar viruses I’ve retrieved from other Tibetan activist groups working on the issue, it is clear it is a work of the Chinese Communist government.” said Namgyal Dolkar.
           </i>
           <p>
             Since becoming a voice for Tibet, she has been constantly being targeted with various malicious emails and cyber attacks such as 1-Click Mobile Exploit <b><sup>12</sup> <span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/09/poison-carp-tibetan-groups-targeted-with-1-click-mobile-exploits/">"Missing Link:Tibetan Groups Targeted with 1-Click Mobile Exploits”</a>  By Bill Marczak, Adam Hulcoop, Etienne Maynier, Bahr Abdul Razzak, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, John Scott-Railton, and Ron Deibert September 24, 2019 (accessed March 24, 2023)</span></b>. She was targeted from 2016 and still continues to receive suspicious emails. The email attacks targeting her were also targeted to other Members of the TPiE. The emails contain either a link or a DOC or PPSX attachment that contains malware which could potentially compromise the user’s system and steal data.
           </p>
           <p>
             In the past, targeted threats were sent through emails with malicious links or attachments to various organizations within the Tibetan exile community. These attacks eventually evolved into targeted website attacks, namely through watering hole attacks. But the November 2018 WhatsApp attacks were the first cases of 1-Click mobile exploits used to target the Tibetan community, showing that operators were changing their tactics in response to the Tibetan community’s awareness campaigns, as well as demonstrating the ongoing digital security challenges Tibetan groups faced. The malware associated with these 1-Click mobile exploits were designed to infect Android and iOS operating systems, indicating that the threat actors were evolving to target mobile devices as well to infect and infiltrate sensitive data from prominent figures in the Tibetan diaspora.
           </p>
           <p>
            Such different espionage campaigns have an underlying commonality which is to focus on clever social engineering rather than the technical sophistication of exploits or malware. They also overlap with two reported campaigns around similar timelines against Uyghur organizations <b><sup>14</sup><span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/09/poison-carp-tibetan-groups-targeted-with-1-click-mobile-exploits/">https://citizenlab.ca/2019/09/poison-carp-tibetan-groups-targeted-with-1-click-mobile-exploits/</a></span></b>, thus reflecting a growing technical and social engineering sophistication in threats targeting the Tibetan community as well as other groups.

              When the internet first came to the Tibetan community, it was not simply a functional tool but a new way to let the world know about Chinese government abuses in Tibet. In the early days, having a platform on the worldwide web meant that information could be accessed globally by anyone around with an internet connection. Subsequently, many offices and institutions such as the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Government in Exile and NGOs started to create their own websites as a way to present themselves to the world and to transmit information in a rapid way previously not possible. Since it is now so commonplace, it’s almost impossible to be able to emphasize how groundbreaking this was, especially for Tibetan organizations who were now able to publish accounts from inside Tibet as well as have Tibet’s recent history online free from China’s propaganda. At the early stages, websites were only in English language as the ability to type in Tibetan script came technologically at a later stage.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, as with email attacks, the Tibetan community were also then targeted with a series of attacks on their websites. Commonly, there are two types of attacks on websites, one is known as a “watering hole attack” which is a form of cyber-attack that targets specific groups of users by infecting websites that they commonly visit. A second type is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack - a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              A case of a DDoS attack was the compromising of Dharamsala based Tibetan media Voice of Tibet’s website. Voice of Tibet started as a Tibetan language short wave radio service in May 1996 and is still one of the few media channels broadcasting news directly into Tibet. The intention of the attacker was to stop the information that Voice of Tibet publishes to reach its audience. 
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2013, their website was a victim of a classic DDoS attack where visitors weren’t able to view the content on their website. Moreover, their shockwave radio which is an unconventional radio communication type of electromagnetic wave that was broadcast into Tibet has often jammed. "No matter how much the Chinese repress Tibetans, they can't stop the flow of information," said Tenzin Peldon, Chief Editor at VOT. "Of course, the Chinese government tries to jam our program consistently, and we try to fight them by broadcasting our programs on different frequencies, at different times, so if one program is jammed, other ones get through." Peldon added <b><sup>15</sup><span><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-27-the-high-tech-war-on-tibetan-communication.html">https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-27-the-high-tech-war-on-tibetan-communication.html</a></span></b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Tibetans, websites are an important tool to preserve the cultural heritage, bring a sense of community among Tibetans, political advocacy on political rights and raise awareness about the human rights violations in Tibet. But the DDoS attacks that were observed in the Tibetan community have caused disruption to the flow of information to the viewers. Similar to VOT, TibetTimes, a Tibetan media group, Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) were also victims of such attacks. 
            </p>
            <p>
              However, TibetTimes were also targeted with a watering hole attack. In 2013, when the TibetTimes website URL was scanned in urlquery.net, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware, it showed that a Dynamic DNS was detected, meaning that visitors to the TibetTimes website would be also opening a malicious domain xunmendluosuo[.]freetcp[.]com which would potentially install malware on the system.

            <p>
              Tibetan Homes Foundation’s website attack was yet another classic example of a watering hole attack. It is quite interesting that the TIbetan Homes Foundation is a school and is not affiliated to any political entities and even so their website was compromised.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Mandiant report on APT1 - Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, the Tibetan Homes Foundation’s website is listed along with many other domains <b><sup>16</sup><span><a href="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf">https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf</a></span></b>. The compromised website would spread backdoors signed with Winnti stolen certificates delivered with Flash exploits <b><sup>17</sup><span><a href="https://securelist.com/winnti-stolen-digital-certificates-re-used-in-current-watering-hole-attacks-on-tibetan-and-uyghur-groups-3/35692/">https://securelist.com/winnti-stolen-digital-certificates-re-used-in-current-watering-hole-attacks-on-tibetan-and-uyghur-groups-3/35692/</a></span></b>.

                In addition to various targeted attacks, there is yet another attack the Tibetan community has faced - the impersonation of prominent civil society organizations or institutions for the purpose of sending malware and misleading targets.
              </p>
              <p>
                In December 2018, we came across an email address mediabureauin[@]gmail[.]com that was using the credentials of the Tibetan Women’s Association (TWA) to deliver a malicious attachment to Tibetan media groups and the Central Tibetan Administration. The TWA is an organization that was founded in Tibet on March 12, 1959. On that day - known as Women's Uprising Day - thousands of Tibetan women in Lhasa gathered to protest the illegal occupation of Tibet by Communist China. On September 10, 1984, the TWA was officially reinstated in exile with 12 branches throughout India. 
              </p>
              <p>
                TWA's main objective is to raise public awareness of the abuses faced by Tibetan women in Chinese-occupied Tibet. Through extensive publicity and involvement in national and international affairs, TWA alerts communities to the gender-specific human rights abuses committed against Tibetan women in the form of forced birth control policies such as sterilizations and abortions, and restrictions on religious, political, social, and cultural freedoms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The impersonation attacks spanned over 3 years from 2018 to 2021 and the emails that were supposedly sent from TWA were based on different themes. Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the threat actors used the self-immolation theme to send a PPSX file, a malicious Microsoft PowerPoint, to a mailing list run by the CTA to different Tibetan media groups and CTA departments.

                After COVID-19 was in India, from July 2020, we observed a COVID-19 theme based attacks where the attacker would send either a Handbook for Public Protection against Covid-19.rar, a malicious attachment or a malicious link. However, this time, the attacker used the email  delekhospitalcovid19[@]yahoo[.]com to impersonate Delek Hospital, a Tibetan hospital founded in 1971 by Tibetans in exile and their supporters and located in Dharamshala, that serves the Tibetan residents and local community in the region. 
              </p>
              <img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="image4" class="img-fluid">
              <p>
                At the beginning of 2021, we noticed another impersonation attack that was again using the credentials of TWA to send malicious attachments and links using the theme of self-immolation - a ‘tribute to heroes’, this time the emails targeted the Library of Tibetan Works and Archive and offices of CTA abroad.
              </p>
              <p>
                TWA sent an email to all the recipients of the malicious emails asking them to report the emails as “SCAM” and to not click on the links and attachments in the emails. It is not known whether the recipients' computers were compromised from the malicious emails.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are further cases of similar attacks where the threat actor has used an individual’s credentials to send malware to different entities of the Tibetan community. Due to the risks faced by making the information about the cases public, they have been omitted from this report.

            <p>Nearly one million Tibetan children today live in colonial boarding schools and preschools. This includes an estimated 100,000 children aged 4-6 in preschools, and 800,000-900,000 children aged 6-18 in primary and secondary schools. Children live apart from their families, are made to speak Chinese, and are blocked from accessing their own language and culture. Families are coerced into sending their children – both through threats by authorities, and lack of alternatives.</p>

                Lhamo Dhondup, now known as Tenzin Gyatso, was born July 6, 1935, in a small farming village in Northeastern Tibet. After four years of searching, the High Lamas found him at the age of two. He was then officially recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama. In 1940, Tenzin Gyatso went on a three-month journey to Lhasa, where he was formally instated as the 14th Dalai Lama.

              <p class="mt-4">The Republic of China declared a plan to invade Tibet, an independent state at the time. Tibet turned to the United Nations for support in a peaceful resolution. At a conference in Beijing, Tibetan representatives negotiated the “Seventeen-Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet.” This treaty prevented China from attempting to change any religious, cultural or political institutions or traditions.

              <p class="mt-4">At a pivotal time in Tibet’s history, the people demonstrated nationalism when they discovered China’s plan to capture the Dalai Lama. On March 10, 1959, Tibet launched a demonstration of 300,000 people at Norbulingka Palace to protect the Dalai Lama.
            On March 19, the Chinese began to shell the area in hopes of deterring a full-out uprising. Over the course of a few days, the Chinese military had killed more than 86,000 Tibetans. The Dalai Lama fled to India two days earlier. Approximately 1.2 million Tibetans died due to the Chinese rule.</p>
