### Tibcert Threat Story
[https://tibcert.org/threat-story](https://tibcert.org/threat-story)

In many ways, the Tibetan community has been under constant attack ever since coming into exile in 1959. This report seeks to examine the ways in which attacks and threats have evolved in today’s digital age starting from approximately 2002 and spanning roughly twenty years.

Since Tibet’s illegal occupation by China from the early 1950s onwards, Tibetans inside Tibet have resisted and this resistance continues today. Since His Holiness the Dalai Lama was forced to flee from Lhasa in March 1959 and live in exile in India, the Tibetan exile community that has grown into hundreds of thousands of people have been continuing resistance and vocally opposing China’s rule at the grassroots and advocacy level. The global recognition for the Dalai Lama, the resistance activities led by Tibetans both inside and outside Tibet, the activities of the Tibetan Government in Exile (Central Tibetan Administration) as well as a worldwide Tibet network of Tibet Support Groups are a constant obstruction to the Chinese government’s efforts for full control over Tibet and a threat to China’s reputation.
