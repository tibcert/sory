<p>A young Tibetan woman living in Northern India takes a trip back to her village in Tibet to visit family. For the last two years she has been working for Drewla, a Tibetan NGO that provides ways for Tibetans inside Tibet to connect with the diaspora online. The trip does not go as planned.</p>

<p>When she reaches the Nepalese-Tibetan border she is immediately taken into detention and held for two months. Chinese authorities interrogate her about her employment in Dharamsala. The young woman denies being involved in any political activities and insists she went to Dharamsala for studies. The authorities present a stack of chat transcripts from conversations she has had online. They explain they have been monitoring Drewla and know about its activities. They eventually release the woman and allow her to travel to her village with a message for her colleagues back in Dharamsala: “You are not welcome to return to Tibet”.</p>

<p>Drewla was indeed under surveillance. Researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto ran an investigation into the networks of Drewla and other Tibetan organizations in 2009 and found they were all infected by malware that connected to GhostNet, a digital espionage network.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The goal of GhostNet was to maintain clandestine access to computer networks and communications for as long as possible.</p>

<p>Tibetans were not the only targets. GhostNet infiltrated over a thousand computers in over one hundred countries around the world. The command and control servers used to operate the malware were traced back to China, and the targets all had a common connection: geopolitical interest to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Exposing this network revealed to the world a dark truth that Tibetans had known for years: China uses targeted malware as a form of digital espionage to spy on its opponents.</p>

<p>The Tibetan community has been targeted by digital espionage for over 20 years by groups with ties to the PRC. These coordinated campaigns aim to infiltrate the communications and data of key people and organizations in the movement. This form of spying violates rights to privacy, assembly, and free speech. Digital espionage is a form of transnational repression that extends the reach of authoritarian states beyond their borders to surveil, harass, and intimidate political opponents and marginalized groups. By infiltrating digital communications and preemptively identifying dissent, the PRC aims to counteract any challenges to its authority, both domestically and internationally.</p>

<p>Targeted espionage campaigns against the Tibetan movement have been widely documented by Threat Intelligence companies and research groups.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Missing from these reports are the voices of the community and discussion of how decades of digital espionage impact the movement. This report documents the history of digital espionage against the Tibetan community through first hand accounts of targeted people and groups. These stories reveal the harms of digital transnational repression and show how the Tibetan movement has built capacity to defend against the threat.</p>

<p>The arduous history of digital espionage against the Tibetan community acts as a canary in the coal mine for global civil society. We provide a warning that harnessing the power of information technology for social movements requires vigilant attention to digital security. The stories shared in this report present the harms of digital threats while also offering a message of empowerment that shows how social movements under repression from authoritarianism can persevere and continue to speak truth to power.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="the-tibet-movement-goes-online">The Tibet Movement Goes Online</h2>

<p>Dharamshala, a small city in Northern India has been the central hub of the Tibetan diaspora since His Holiness the Dalai Lama made it his residence after escaping from Tibet in 1959.</p>

<p>The first connection to the Internet in Dharamshala was administered by the Tibetan Computer Resource Centre (TCRC), a department of the Tibetan Government in Exile (TGiE, now known as the Central Tibetan Administration, CTA) that provides technical support Accessing email required going to the roof of the TCRC office, where there was a single computer available.</p>

<p>The next step was navigating a complex process to send messages that were stored in Delhi, where they would wait for forwarding on to the final recipient. There was only one address for sending or receiving email for the entire community.</p>

<p>The community truly came online in the mid-1990s thanks to efforts from Dan Haig and a group of volunteers. Dan Haig did early work on the World Wide Web in California before coming to Dharamsala to study Tibetan medicine. Given his technical expertise he soon found himself helping the Tibetan Government in Exile connect to the Internet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In January of 1996, I registered tibet.org, which marked the beginning of my involvement with the Tibet movement. Unexpectedly, this journey led me to various places I had never envisioned. Concurrently, I maintained communication with Phuntsok Namgyal.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>About a year and a half later, I found myself in India with four companions, equipped with everything necessary to establish a network connecting all the offices in Gangkyi.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This network facilitated a dial-in connection from the Private Office and Norbulingka Institute, among other locations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our goal was to usher the Tibetan exile community and the government-in-exile into the Internet age.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>–Dan Haig</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Dan and his friends, together with the TCRC, helped the TGiE set up an Internet-connected Local Area Network between all seven ministries, the Kashag, Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, and provided several other offices with dialup connectivity to the Private Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL), the Norbulingka Institute and other key community organizations.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>On December 18 1996, the website DalaiLama.com was registered.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> At that time, monks from the OHHDL were managing the Office’s email, maintaining databases, hosting the website, and managing the content. The OHHDL used email to schedule His Holiness’ meetings with international diplomats and religious leaders around the globe.</p>

<p><img src="images/dalailama.jpg" alt="/images/dalailama.jpg" /></p>

<p>DalaiLama.com webpage from 1999 archived online<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2000, the TGiE’s web presence (Tibet.Net) was established and the community network consisted of over 120 computers.[^6]</p>

<p>It was also around this time that the wider Tibetan community both in India and abroad started to come online.  Exposure to the Internet transformed the cause for human rights in Tibet from a regionalized effort to a globally coordinated movement. However, as the community came online, information security threats followed. Dan Haig recounts how at this early stage of Internet connectivity, digital espionage emerged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“During that time, we faced minimal hacking issues ourselves, but the Chinese government initiated a deceptive tactic. They began sending emails, spoofing legitimate addresses and claiming they had been compromised. For instance, an email purportedly from me, Daniel D. Haig, was circulated to Tibet Support Groups list. However, it was poorly written and signed as ‘Haig D Daniel,’ which was obviously fake since I typically sign my emails with just a dot and a ‘D.’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the obvious forgery, they refined their approach, enticing recipients to click on links leading to websites hosting malware. Subsequently, they launched an extensive campaign, distributing emails with malicious attachments. Clicking on these attachments would infect computers, leading to a myriad of potential consequences.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>– Dan Haig</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Information technology is a double-edged sword for the Tibetan community. On one hand, it has significantly contributed to strengthening the Tibetan movement, fostering greater communication opportunities, and promoting awareness of Tibetan culture and heritage on a global scale. However, alongside these advancements, the community has become increasingly vulnerable to online threats orchestrated by groups affiliated with the PRC. Exploiting the community’s relatively limited information security capacity, these groups infiltrate communication networks, surveil individuals and organizations, and pose significant challenges to the integrity and security of the Tibetan movement.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="#early-digital-threats-against-the-community">Early Digital Threats Against The Community</h2>

<p>One of the earliest documented incidents of digital espionage against the community was reported in September 2003 by Jigme Tsering, a manager of the Tibetan Computer Resource Centre.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A number of targeted computer viruses circulating via email throughout the Tibetan Government in Exile and Tibetan support groups and related Non-Government Organizations have been discovered or brought to our attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>These viruses have appeared in a number of variants, indicating a progressive and sustained development process. For example, some were taking advantage of known security loopholes in Microsoft software in order to automatically run and are always personalized to impersonate departmental emails following previous attempts to collect email address lists. One variant analyzed was found to have been sourced from the Yunnan Province in China, and was designed to collect information of an infected computer and send it via email to an address in Beijing.”</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>– Jigme Tsering</p>
  </blockquote>

</video>

<p>Targeted malware delivered as file attachments to email messages is one of the most common digital espionage tactics experienced by the Tibetan community</p>

<p>Targeted malware operations typically consist of the following process: The targeted user receives an email, possibly appearing to be from someone they know with a message—sometimes specific, sometimes generic—that urges the user to open an attachment, usually a PDF or Microsoft Office document or visit a website.</p>

<p>If the user opens the attachment or link with a vulnerable version of software that has been targeted for exploitation and no security mitigations are in place, their device will likely be compromised. A clean version of the document is typically embedded in the malicious file and is opened upon successful exploitation so as not to arouse suspicion of the recipient. Once the user’s computer is compromised, operators can extract documents, email and other data, and possibly move laterally through the compromised network to target other devices.</p>

<p>From the early targeting described by Jigme Tsering, digital espionage has followed the community like a long dark shadow. As threats to the community grew it became clear that Tibetans were not alone in this experience. These threats reflected trends that should resonate with civil society globally.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The decades of digital espionage against Tibetans has shown that civil society faces the same level of information security threats as major companies and governments, but with far fewer resources to defend against them.</p>

<p>In 2009, the Information Warfare Monitor (a collaboration between the Citizen Lab and the Secdev Group) published the report “Tracking GhostNet.”^9 The investigation started as a probe into key Tibetan organizations to determine if they were compromised by digital espionage. The result was uncovering the GhostNet digital espionage network that compromised not only the Offices of HHDL and other Tibetan groups but also 1,295 computers in 103 countries around the world 30% of which can be labeled as “high value” targets such as Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Embassies. The investigation traced the command and control servers used to issue commands to compromised machines back to locations in China. However, the researchers were unable to conclusively determine the potential role of the government. What was evident is that this network was performing politically motivated espionage targeting both civil society and governments. From the perspective of the Tibetan community the culprit was clear, it was the government of China.</p>

<p>When the GhostNet report was released, there were almost no public reports on digital espionage. In subsequent years public reporting from the Threat Intelligence industry grew considerably and served as marketing material for companies. In general these reports focus on threats to governments and the private sector which represent the customer base of the industry. Civil society is seldom the focus of these reports with an important exception, the Tibetan community</p>

<p>In the Semi-technical report, TibCERT systematically reviewed threat intelligence reports from 2009 to 2022 and found 63 of these reports documented digital espionage against the Tibetan community. These reports were typically done without any involvement of the Tibetan community and the expensive products and services provided by these companies are outside the grasp of Tibetan groups or any civil society community.</p>

<p>The high number of reports focused on the Tibetan community reflects the high volume of targeted espionage campaigns the community experienced. But this volume does not explain how so many companies had access to the data.</p>

<p>This access can be explained by the popularity of VirusTotal in the Tibetan community. VirusTotal is a service that provides malware analysis of files. The free malware analysis reports provided by the service made it a popular tool for Tibetan journalists and human rights groups to check if files they received were malicious. Any files uploaded to VirusTotal are shared to anti virus and threat intelligence companies that pay the service’s subscription fees. The data feed is provided to help companies improve detection of malware and identify threats. As a result a database of malware began to be made available to companies from targeting experienced by the Tibetan community.</p>

<p>The malware used in these campaigns often mirrored digital espionage activities originating from China that target governments and the private sector. Therefore, reporting on Tibetan threats gave companies a way to publicly disclose details about these threats without having to disclose any sensitive incidents or customer data. The result is threats to the Tibetan community have received more attention from threat intelligence companies than any other civil society movement. These reports provide useful technical information and serve as evidence of decades of targeted espionage. However, typically these private sector reports were done without involvement of the Tibetan community and rarely provided any notifications or incident response support to targeted individuals and groups.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> Therefore, while the reports provided value to companies, the Tibetan community did not receive any direct support.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="on-the-front-lines">On The Front Lines</h2>

<p>While incidents of digital espionage against the Tibetan community are well documented in threat intelligence reports, the focus is almost always on the technical aspects alone. These reports have no understanding of the social and political context in which these threats occur. Without this context it is not possible to understand the harm of digital espionage.</p>

<p>Only paying attention to the malware and other technical tricks being used in digital espionage is like investigating a shooting but only analyzing the gun. When gun crime is investigated, the forensic details of the bullet may help connect similar attacks and maybe even trace it to the shooter, but if the damage against the victim and the context in which the attack happened is ignored the nature and impact of the crime cannot be properly assessed. Digital espionage is no different. A full understanding of digital espionage requires a wider and deeper view into the issue. We interviewed members of the Tibet movement who have been targeted by digital espionage to document the history of the threat against the community and show the impact.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="a-movement-under-surveillance">A Movement Under Surveillance</h2>

<p>The first line of attack in most digital espionage that uses targeted malware is luring targets to perform some kind of action, usually opening a malicious attachment or link. The social engineering tactics used in these intrusion attempts are often highly sophisticated and show a knowledge of the activities and network of the target. This level of sophistication speaks to the effort being put into the espionage campaigns and the amount of information the adversaries already have on their targets. The stories we collected from community members on the frontline of Tibet advocacy share key moments in the history of the movement. This mirroring reflects the persistence of digital threats over decades and shows how closely the adversaries monitor the community.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="surveillance-harassment-and-the-2008-beijing-olympics">Surveillance, Harassment, And the 2008 Beijing Olympics</h2>

<p>In 2008, Beijing played host to the Summer Olympics. The mega event was a major publicity moment for the government of China and accordingly was also a crucial moment to bring attention to human rights abuses in the country.</p>

<p>A wave of protests broke out in Tibet against China’s unceasing violations that undermine the cultural, linguistic, and religious freedom of Tibetans. During this uprising, many Tibetans and Tibet support groups conducted advocacy actions including disrupting the Olympic Torch routes as well as raising awareness of the dire straits inside Tibet on international conferences, events and media platforms.</p>

<p>Kate Woznow was part of this advocacy effort as Campaign Director of Students for a Free Tibet. From Bangkok Thailand, Kate coordinated a flurry of activities including organizing protests and managing media strategies. During this period Skype was a key communications tool for Kate to reach activists across the world from Beijing, London, New York and beyond. These communications were often highly sensitive and Kate and her colleagues took precautions such as using code names to mask their identity. Despite these efforts Kate soon found herself a target of surveillance and harassment.</p>

<p>In July 2008, as the Olympics games opened Kate began to receive suspicious Skype messages. The person on the other end addressed her by her secret code name and also knew the code name for Kate’s colleague Lhadon Tethong, Executive Director of Students for a Free Tibet. The messages were written in a tone to suggest that the person already knew Kate. They asked if she was in Hong Kong and wanted to do an import and export business. The person seemed to be trying to seek out her location and asking about Hong Kong was noteworthy as she had been based there while involved in a 2006 action coordinating a Beijing protest of the railway to Tibet.</p>

<p>The messages left Kate feeling uneasy.</p>

<p><em>“The incident was incredibly intimidating, especially during such a critical moment. It had adverse psychological effects, leading me to question my safety constantly. It was truly an eye-opening encounter for me, highlighting the detrimental implications of underestimating such targeted cyber intrusions. Such incidents can put both individuals and their communities at significant risk.”</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Later on during the Olympic Games and with the activist protests taking place frequently, another similar incident occurred and the people behind the messages were able to directly message Kate and Lhadon on their Skype code names trying to get in touch with them, indicating that they knew that they were leading the Olympics campaign together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It was unnerving to have people on my Skype who knew our code names and who seemed determined to seek out our location. It was the kind of thing that really got into my head because it was intimidating and made me question my safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many ways I think that the psychological effects of this kind of incident is underestimated or not taken into consideration. There was a thuggishness to the tone of the messages that made me feel uncomfortable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="spying-and-self-immolations-in-tibet">Spying &amp; Self Immolations In Tibet</h2>

<p>In the aftermath of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, turmoil engulfed Tibet, with China imposing a crackdown on the human rights of Tibetans. Beyond those involved in the 2008 protests, Tibetan writers, singers, and educators became prime targets of repression.[^11] Reports from the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) revealed that around 600 Tibetans were detained as political prisoners during this period.[^12]</p>

<p>2009 marked a somber turn for Tibetans when a 20-year-old monk from Kirti monastery named Lobsang Tashi (or Tapey to his friends) self-immolated in protest against Chinese policies. As his body burned in protest Chinese police shot him and put him into custody.[^13]</p>

<p>Tapey was the first Tibetan to self-immolate in modern Tibet. His protest was understood as</p>

<p>a plea for international attention to China’s oppressive measures in Tibet.</p>

<p>Over the next nine years, 159 Tibetans followed this controversial form of protest and self-immolated. Through this act they called for the return of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and freedom for Tibet. This unprecedented series of self immolations was a major concern for the Tibet movement asd it showed the measures Tibetans in Tibet were prepared to take to bring attention to the dire human rights situation.</p>

<p>During this time, Lhadon Tethong was Director of the Tibet Action Institute. Like all leaders in the Tibet Movement Lhadon paid close attention to the self-immolations and worked tirelessly to bring international attention to them.</p>

<p>In February 2012, Lhadon received an email from Cheng Li, a notable Chinese-American scholar who was Director of Research at The Brookings Institution, a prestigious Washington DC think tank. In the email, Mr. Li explained to Lhadon that he would be attending an academic conference on religious research in Shanghai and would like to learn more about Tibetan self immolations. The email included a spreadsheet that Mr. Li explained listed Tibetans who had self-immolated since 2009. He asked Lhadon to review the document for him.</p>

<p>On the first read Lhadon felt flattered by the request from a prominent China expert. However, she quickly determined that the email was not sent from the real Cheng Li. A telltale sign was that the email was sent from a suspicious AOL account (chengli.brookings@ aol.com).</p>

<p>As a leader in the Tibet movement Lhadon had become accustomed to receiving emails with malicious files and messages designed to entice her to open them. The constant targeting she experienced made her weary of any messages she received. While these types of emails were routine to Lhadon, this particular message left her feeling vulnerable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I remembered thinking that this was good, a well crafted, researched targeted attack  and I wouldn’t say I was impressed but maybe my blood ran a little cold recognizing how sophisticated  cyber attacks can be and there was no question to deny that it must be a Chinese government backed attack.”</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>– Lhadon Tethong</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
Lhadon sent the email to researchers at the Citizen Lab who verified the attachment contained malware designed to infect computers running Windows.^14 This finding confirmed Lhadon’s suspicions the email was a clever attempt at breaking into her computer and spying on her.</p>

<p>Following this revelation, Lhadon and the Citizen Lab researchers devised their own ruse to turn the table on the attackers. Lhadon wrote back to “Cheng Li” with some information about the type of computer she was using as bait that the attackers may be interested in.</p>

<p><em>“Thank you for your inquiry. I’d be happy to help out–I’m having trouble opening the document on my Mac though, I think there may be an issue with the Chinese character font? I think if you sent me a Word version that might be easiest, as it would also allow me to make comments in the document.”</em></p>

<p>A few days later the Cheng Li imposter wrote back with a polite message apologizing for the delay in replying and noting he still had to prepare his report on self immolations so there was time for Lhadon to send him comments. The email included a link to a report that was in fact directed towards a website that would serve the visitor malware for windows or a Mac depending on the computer they were using. This response led Lhadon and the Citizen Lab researchers to conclude that the attackers had taken the bait they left in her message.</p>

<p>Lhadon told them she was using a Mac, and they likely spent the next four days putting together malware that could infect Macs. This digital espionage attempt stood out for the social engineering used to convincingly masquerade as Cheng Li and the technical adaptations the attackers made in real time in hopes of getting access to Lhadon’s communications and data.</p>

<p>While tricking the attackers was an empowering moment, overall the experience left an emotional toll on Lhadon.</p>

<p><em>“The attack left me reeling, shattering my sense of security and trust in my online interactions. It amplified my feelings of vulnerability and paranoia. Considering the confidential nature of my work, the breach threatened to compromise sensitive information, adding another layer of anxiety to my already demanding role.”</em></p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="spying-on-the-tibetan-movement-during-covid">Spying On The Tibetan Movement During Covid</h2>

<p>Digital espionage campaigns often take advantage of targeted communities when they are the most vulnerable such as periods of emergency. The COVID pandemic provided a perfect environment for digital espionage operators to spread a different type of infection.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the world the COVID pandemic hit the Tibetan community in early 2020. Tibetans in India were particularly vulnerable due to the availability of health services and the closely knit nature of the community which made self isolation difficult. While dealing with the daily challenges of the pandemic, Tibetans also found themselves under attack from digital espionage campaigns that leveraged COVID as a theme to spread malicious emails.</p>

<p>Emails circulated that appeared to be from a Tibetan human rights group that included a PowerPoint slide deck that claimed to have information about how China was effectively managing the coronavirus outbreak. The emails all contained malware.</p>

<p>A few months later another espionage email campaign started that spoofed the account of Delek Hospital, one of the main healthcare institutions for the community. The emails included a document with information on “Public Protection against Covid-19”. However, again this was a trick and the document was malware designed to spy on the community.</p>

<p>Another COVID-19 theme based email attack was observed with its sender description displayed as “DIIR INFO Secretary’’. Although the content of the supposedly email guideline seemed to be coming from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the interesting fact here is that DIIR is the Department of Information and International Relations (DIIR) which comes under the CTA. However the sender address as mentioned in the mail may be a misspelling of a prominent Tibetan individual who provided reports and first hand information of the self-immolations incidents inside Tibet to the international media. He is a well known and respected member of the Tibetan community who, due to his work in getting information from inside Tibet to journalists, has also developed a significant media presence around him. With the onset of privacy and security implications of the concerned person, we have kept his personal identity confidential.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="impersonation-and-trust">Impersonation &amp; Trust</h2>

<p>Digital espionage against the community often impersonates known people and groups by sending messages and emails that appear to come from trusted sources. Through these impersonations malware can spread through the community and undermine the credibility of Tibetan groups.</p>

<p>The Tibetan Women’s Association (TWA) is a key group in the Tibet movement that originates in the courageous protests of Tibetan women against the illegal occupation of Tibet by China in 1959. Targeted digital espionage campaigns have impersonated TWA to send malicious messages to other groups for years.</p>

<p>In December 2018, a malicious email, purportedly from the TWA, circulated within the community. The email included a malicious attachment titled ‘Tibet was never a part of China’. Clicking on the attachment would infect the target’s computer with malware capable of extracting sensitive information. Similarly, in 2021, another impersonated email, titled ‘Inside Tibet and from the Tibetan exile community’, targeted institutions like the Library of Tibetan Works and Archive and offices of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) abroad. For victims using Firefox browser with Gmail logged in, clicking the malicious link grants near-total access to their Gmail accounts. These impersonation attacks not only exploit the trust and reputation of Tibetan institutions but also undermine the collective security of the Tibetan community.</p>

<p>Kelsang Dolma, the General Secretary of the TWA recounts the impact the incident had on the group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This incident caused us a lot of concern not only on the individual level but also on an organizational level. As an activist association, such impersonation and intrusion attempts to our important files and financial accounts will jeopardize the credibility and trustworthiness of our association within our society.”</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>– Kelsang Dolma (General Secretary TWA)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
Responding to the threat, the TWA promptly alerted recipients of the malicious emails to report them and refrain from clicking on any links or attachments. Additionally, TibCERT proactively reached out to organizations that received similar emails, urging them to assess their systems and networks for potential compromise.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="poisoning-the-well">Poisoning The Well</h2>

<p>Targeted malware is not only delivered through emails or messages. It can also spread through the community by infecting trusted websites. Like a village well, websites for Tibetan media and organizations serve as vital resources for the community. If you poison the well, you poison the village. A “watering hole attack” describes this type of action online. Attackers get unauthorized access to websites and infect them with malware. When visitors visit the website they are at risk of their computer being infected by the malware and giving access to the attackers. The modus operandi of these attacks is particularly insidious, as compromised websites automatically download malware onto visitors’ devices without their knowledge. This method bypasses the need for attackers to target individuals individually, streamlining the process, and maximizing the impact.</p>

<p>Many Tibetan websites have experienced watering hole attacks including media sites and official websites for key organizations such as the Central Tibetan Administration and the Offices of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> Community resource websites have also fallen victim including Tibetan Homes Foundation, and a Tibetan school in the diaspora.</p>

<p>Tibet Times started as a Tibetan-language newspaper before evolving into a comprehensive media outlet, offering a Tibetan-language website and a mobile app to disseminate accurate information and breaking news about Tibet. In 2013, a scan for malicious ;omls on the TibetTimes website revealed a disturbing discovery: visitors to the site unwittingly opened a malicious domain, potentially exposing their devices to malware.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When this kind of attack happens to us, it not only tarnishes the credibility of Tibet Times among our viewers but more importantly it jeopardizes their safety as well through potential device infections.  Naturally it also creates a worrisome and annoying situation in our working process.”</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>– Tenzin Rabyang, Managing Director at Tibet Times</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Websites like TibetTimes that publish news on the human rights violations occurring inside Tibet, covering in TIbetan, English and Chinese, attracting visitors from Tibet and worldwide. However, these attacks not only harm the credibility and integrity of TibetTimes but also endanger website visitors. For individuals from Tibet, such attacks could have serious consequences, if found accessing or sharing content deemed sensitive by the PRC, individuals could face harassment, surveillance, or even legal repercussions.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="attempts-to-silence-the-voice-of-tibet">Attempts To Silence The Voice Of Tibet</h2>

<p>Targeted digital espionage is not the only threat that Tibetan groups experience. Some digital attacks are aimed at silencing groups through attacks on websites.</p>

<p>Voice of Tibet (VOT) is an independent radio station founded in 1996 with a mission to transmit news to Tibetans inside Tibet and around the world. Tibetan exile media like VOT present a clear threat to the censorship regime of China by providing independent news to Tibetans inside Tibet in both Tibetan and Mandarin. The VOT website is blocked in China and its transmissions online and over the air comes under constant threat.</p>

<p>In 2011, VOT experienced massive disruptions of its website and radio signal. The website was taken offline by a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack overwhelming the website with too much traffic. This type of digital threat works by flooding a website with too many requests than it can handle resulting in poor performance or even complete crashes. It’s like shutting down a road by causing a massive traffic jam. At the same time as the DDoS attack, VOT’s shortwave radio transmissions into Tibet experienced persistent jamming attempts.</p>

<p>For VOT what happened was clear, it had been attacked by agents of China in an attempt to silence the service. Oystein Alme, then the project manager at VOT, remarked: “We have noted a significant increase in jamming since 16 March, especially in the cities where the government has invested tens of millions of dollars to install antennae to prevent Tibetans from listening to us.”^16</p>

<p>Tenzin Peldon, Chief Editor at VOT, emphasized the resilience of Tibetan media in the face of adversity, acknowledging the ongoing battle against Chinese censorship. Despite relentless attempts to disrupt their broadcasts,^17 Peldon affirmed VOT’s commitment to circumventing censorship through innovative programming strategies. However, the repercussions of these attacks extended beyond VOT, impacting the broader Tibetan community’s access to vital information and cultural preservation efforts.^18</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We were not able to reach our audience on time since our job was to get the news and information about Tibet to the Tibetans inside Tibet right on time. We couldn’t do that for several days because of the attack and I felt that all of our efforts have gone wasted.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

 </video>

<p>Websites served as more than just information hubs; they were vital platforms for cultural preservation, community building, and political advocacy. Threats like DDoS attacks disrupt the flow of information and impede the community’s ability to raise awareness about human rights violations in Tibet. Other Tibetan media and civil society groups including Tibet Times, Phayul, and the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), also faced similar assaults, highlighting the systematic targeting of Tibetan voices by malicious actors. As Tibetans continue to navigate the digital landscape, safeguarding their online platforms becomes paramount to upholding their right to free expression and preserving their cultural heritage.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="the-spy-in-your-pocket">The Spy In Your Pocket</h2>

<p>In the early 2010s, the rise of smartphones introduced new opportunities for connectivity for the Tibetan community. The ubiquity of mobile technology connected Tibetans in Tibet and the diaspora in ways that had not been experienced before. Reports from inside became available as events happened. Families separated by exile went from periodic updates to daily communications. But as this new connectivity flourished espionage threats went mobile as well.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="mobile-threats-emerge">Mobile Threats Emerge</h2>

<p>In 2011, WeChat, a mobile messaging application, launched and has become the most popular communications platform in China and quickly spread to Tibetan populations. The popularity of WeChat became a concern due to the app being under the control of a Chinese company and therefore subject to information controls dictated by the Chinese government. Reports of censorship and suspected surveillance on WeChat began to circulate in the community</p>

<p>Tibet Action Institute is an activist organization that uses digital technology and strategic nonviolent action to support the Tibet movement. In response to digital security concerns surrounding WeChat, Tibet Action Institute promoted alternative communications apps to Tibetans including KakaoTalk (a South Korean chat app).</p>

<p>Lobsang Gyatso Sither, then serving as the Digital Security Program Manager at Tibet Action Institute promoted this campaign by sending trusted contacts installation files for the apps on Android (Android Application Package File, APKs).</p>

<p>On December 4, 2012, Lobsang sent an email to a member of the Tibetan Parliament that included APKs for KakaoTalk and Internet radio apps with instructions on how to install and use the apps.</p>

<p>On January 16, 2013, a high profile member of the Tibetan community received an identical email that appeared to also come from Lobsang. This email was a fake and attached APK files with additional features that were designed to send a user’s contacts, SMS message history, and cellular network location to attackers.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>This chain of events suggests that the email of the Tibetan Parliamentarian who first received the real email was already compromised, giving the attackers access to the message and showing them that Tibetans were circulating APKs through their networks of trust. The attackers then repurposed the message and modified the APKs to include malware.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>” As someone working on digital security and constantly looking at phishing attacks, it was a surprise to see your own email being used for phishing purposes and I wasn’t sure how to feel about it. Once I learned more about the attack, the fact that I had no idea how many people might have been lured with this email was scary. Also, how something that is meant for allowing people to access information has been repurposed by the Chinese Government to spy on them made me angry. It also made me realize the truth that Tibetans are targeted as a community and our response has to be community led.”</p>
</blockquote>

 </video>

<p>This attack was one of the first examples of mobile malware we observed in the community and showed how digital threats against the community adapt. As Tibetans went mobile, so did the threats.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="one-click-away-from-compromise">One Click Away From Compromise</h2>

<p>The sophistication of social engineering used to lure targets to install mobile malware and the technical sophistication of the malware itself has significantly escalated in recent years.</p>

<p>Between November 2018 and May 2019, senior members of key Tibetan groups received malicious links in individually tailored WhatsApp text messages made to appear to be from</p>

<p>NGO workers, journalists, and other fake personas. The links led to code designed to exploit web browser vulnerabilities to install spyware on iOS and Android devices. This kind of threat is called a “one click exploit”, because all it takes is one click of a link for a target to be compromised. This espionage campaign is one of the most sophisticated we have observed in the community over the last decade.</p>

<p>Among the targets of this campaign was Namgyal Dolkar, a Tibetan parliamentarian. On the night of November 12, 2018, she received a WhatsApp message from “Jason Wu” who claimed to be the head of the Refugee Group at Amnesty International’s Hong Kong branch. Namgyal Dolkar often receives unsolicited messages from human rights organizations seeking her assistance so this message did not seem out of the ordinary. She replied to “Jason” who proceeded to describe a recent self-immolation in Tibet, asked her to help verify the incident for an upcoming Amnesty International report on human rights in China, and sent a link. Namgyal Dolkar forwarded the message to TibCERT who in collaboration with researchers at the Citizen Lab discovered the link connected to exploits designed to infect iPhone and Android devices with malware.^20</p>

<p>Amnesty International does not employ anyone named Jason Wu. The message was very carefully crafted to trick Namgyal Dolkar into clicking the link, which would infect her phone with malware. For Namgyal Dolkar, the real sender of the message was clear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Considering the work we do, which directly revolves around exposing China for its various forms of human rights abuses in Tibet, and also because similar viruses I’ve retrieved from other Tibetan activist groups working on the issue, it is clear it is a work of the Chinese Communist government.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>– Namgyal Dolkar</p>

    <source class="embed-responsive-item " src="images/Namgyal Dolkar.mp4 " type="video/mp4" paused="" />
 </video>

<p>In total, we found 17 high profile members of the Tibetan community who were targeted by the same campaign including members of the Offices of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the Central Tibet Administration, Tibetan Parliamentarians and Tibetan human rights groups. This campaign was highly organized and targeted with multiple fake personas used. In every case the fake persona engaged the target in a conversation and once an exchange had started would send a malicious link. All it would take is one click of the link for the target’s phone to be turned into a spy in their pocket.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 ftco-section ftco-animate" id="the-community-responds">The Community Responds</h2>

<p>From the moment the Tibetan community came online we have faced persistent digital espionage. Over decades of being targeted, the community has grown capacities and resilience for defending against digital threats.</p>

<p>A key mission of Tibet Action institute is to defend against relentless cyber attacks and surveillance from China. Since its inception, the group has led campaigns for digital security awareness and training.^21 Efforts include digital security education campaigns focused on fundamental topics such as basic web browser security and how to prevent malware infection. These campaigns feature references to Tibetan culture such as the Detach from Attachments campaign that played on a piece of Buddhist wisdom.^22 The message of the campaign is simple: don’t send attachments, don’t open attachments, and consider cloud-based platforms such as Google Drive or Dropbox as an alternative for sharing files.</p>

<p>This type of behavior change can be an effective way to defend against targeted digital espionage. A study from the Citizen Lab found that in the early 2010s malicious file attachments were the most common threat Tibetan organizations received. The researchers found that simply not opening email attachments would have prevented over 95 percent of the threats the Tibetan groups in the study received.<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> These findings show that education is an essential foundation for increasing digital security defense. However, there is an inherent asymmetry between the digital defenses of Tibetan groups and the capabilities of the operators who target them.</p>

<p>State sponsored espionage operators have exponentially more resources to develop and conduct digital espionage than civil society has to defend themselves. As our review of digital espionage shows, threats evolve over time and are quick to adapt to changes in how the community uses technology and implements defenses. Changing the behaviour of a community is a slow and gradual process, while an adversary can evolve overnight. Therefore, while education and training are essential efforts that must continue, there needs to be more to properly respond to the threat.</p>

<p>In 2018, members of the Tibetan community formed the Tibetan Computer Emergency Readiness Team (TibCERT)^24 in Dharamsala, India, in November 2018. TibCERT follows the standard model for CERTS (Computer Emergency Readiness Teams) which are expert groups that handle computer security incidents. Countries have government run CERTS that operate on the national level tasked with protecting their country from digital threats. There are also sector level CERTS that facilitate threat intelligence sharing between companies in specific areas such as finance. TibCERT operates in this model to provide threat intelligence sharing, incident response, and technical support to Tibetan member organizations. TibCERT includes two main programs. TibCERT Recon focuses investigating threats facing Tibetans in exile and surveillance within Tibet. TibCERT Response facilitates knowledge sharing and collaborative threat mitigation among stakeholders. Forming a professionalized Computer Emergency Readiness Team for the Tibetan community represents a significant milestone in developing robust resilience to digital threats.</p>

<p>Lobsang Gyatso Sither, one of the founders of TibCERT, reflects on the motivations to start the group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There were a number of reasons why TibCERT was formed. It came from discussions internally and with partners at the Citizen Lab about how the Tibetan community in the diaspora has been targeted with spyware as a community and any solution that we develop must be community led.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time, there was another reason which was about taking the online CERT space back for Tibet so that TibCERT is an entity responsible for protecting the digital space for both Tibetans inside Tibet and outside Tibet. Our goal is to build internal capacity and also standardize the structure of this community led initiative so that it can partner with global researchers on shared protocols.”</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>– Lobsang Gyatso Sither
<br /></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>To extend its reach, TibCERT has deployed Digital Security Ambassadors in major settlements in India, providing technical assistance and incident response to local communities. Additionally, TibCERT has initiated the TibCERT Response Hub Program, establishing hubs in Dharamshala, Mundgod, and Bylakuppe, where volunteers convene monthly to address community-specific challenges and implement solutions. In 2022, TibCERT expanded its reach by establishing two TibCERT Community Centers in South India, dedicated to addressing digital security challenges, particularly within monastic institutions.</p>

<p>Currently encompassing over 50 organizations and institutions, TibCERT seeks to broaden its reach within the diaspora community, offering incident response services for suspicious emails and assisting in the implementation of digital security policies. These efforts aim to foster a secure work environment and fortify the overall digital resilience of Tibetan individuals and organizations within the community and beyond.</p>

<p>The Tibetan community has had to prioritize digital security out of necessity. The Tibetan diaspora is one of the first communities to be targeted by government sponsored digital espionage and has experienced the threat for decades. However, Tibetans are far from the only community facing these challenges. This type of threat extends to civil society around the world. Countless investigations have shown that the sponsors and operators of these operations often share tactics, techniques, and procedures. It is time for civil society to demonstrate similar coordination and strategies to exchange knowledge and data about threats and share best practices in defending against them. Given the common experience of civil society groups confronting information security challenges, a collective approach may yield greater benefits than attempting to tackle these threats in isolation.</p>

<p>The goal of sharing the first hand experiences of Tibetans targeted by digital espionage and how our community responds to this challenge is informing and inspiring the struggles of human rights groups who may just be becoming aware of digital espionage.</p>

<p>The Tibetan community must continue to work together to maintain resilience to digital espionage and the long reach of China. We also must stand in solidarity with civil society groups around the world that are facing transnational repression from authoritarian regimes. Together we can empower each other and form a more secure, free, and open Internet that enables movements to create positive social change.</p>

<h3 id="general-comments">GENERAL COMMENTS</h3>

<p>There are great stories here, but they should be reorganized so together they tell a wider compelling narrative. The key is to show the community has been targeted for decades and this persistent targeting is a major violation of human rights including freedom of speech, assembly, privacy, etc.</p>

<p>Think of this output less of a report and more of a story. You need to make people care about the issue and feel a sense of intimacy with it based on the testimonials of community members. You need to guide the reader on this journey. It should be engaging and relatable for someone who has never heard about digital espionage against the Tibetan community. It should serve as an accessible introduction to the issue that spells out the implications in plain language.</p>

<p>The distinction between individuals, organizations, and community used to structure section 4 is not useful for story telling. If you think about it, any of these incidents can be framed as attacks against the community / movement as a whole whether they are directed to one person’s email or a website, etc. Also attacks against Kate and Lhadon are attacks against key leaders so they are also against the organizations.</p>

<p>I would make the structure of these stories more thematic and group them together to make bigger points. For example, the Kate and Lhadon stories show how at different vital points of the movement, (2008 Olympics, Wave of self immolations), the movement was targeted by digital espionage.</p>

<p>The Lobsang and Lhagyari Namgyal Dolkar stories show how these threats evolved to target mobile platforms. It’s very important in these last two stories to show how the sophistication of the threats improved.</p>

<p>So now as an example these two themes together show how persistent and resourced these espionage campaigns are and how they have evolved over a decade.</p>

<p>In this way they can tell a wider story and make the main message obvious to the reader.</p>

<p>Here’s a way to sequence the stories. Think of each story as a headline in a newspaper. What’s the hook? What’s the main story?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Olympics - Kate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Self Immolations - Lhadon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>COVID
Main message – persistent, targeted espionage for over a decade. The espionage operators pay very close attention to the community and prey on issues of concern. Show the clear human rights implications. Violations against privacy, right to assembly, free speech, etc. These are the harms of digital espionage. Put another way digital espionage is a human rights violation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TWA
Main message – a key org in the Tibetan movement run by Women has been persistently targeted by digital espionage for decades</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attack against Voice of Tibet (VOT)
Make the headline and focus here about DDOS as CENSORSHIP. This example shows that espionage is not always the objective, sometimes it’s censorship. This action is a threat to freedom of expression. They are not just trying to censor the website in Tibet / China, they are trying to silence it for the WORLD.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Website attack against Tibet Times
Make the headline and story about watering hole attacks. Explain the concept in plain language as if you were explaining it to someone at a training for the first time. Lead with the metaphor that the website is like a village well. It’s where the community gets their water (information). If you poison the well you poison the community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Tibetan MP and Spoofed Apps (2013)
Make the headline about an evolution of threats to targeting Mobile</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lhagyari Namgyal Dolkar and WhatsApp (2018)
The headline should be about the escalation of attacks. You can accurately call this campaign the most sophisticated mobile espionage against the community.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For the community response section make it more of a story. Right now it reads like a summary you would have in a grant report, which is OK for that purpose but here you want to tell a story and have people relate to it. Include quotes from Lobsang and others talking about why it was set up, what it means to them, and vision for the community. Make it personal and relatable just like the previous stories.</p>
